This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that show how to use Batfish for different analysis and validation tasks. All network snapshots used in the notebooks are in the `networks` subfolder. 

The current list of notebooks are:
- [Getting Started with Batfish](Getting%20started%20with%20Batfish.ipynb)
  - Shows how to get started and provides an overview of the capabilities of Batfish.
- [Validating Configuration Settings](Validating%20Configuration%20Settings.ipynb)
   - Shows how you can validate different types of configuration settings (NTP server, TACACS server, AAA, SNMP, etc...) using Batfish. 
- [Introduction to Route Analysis](Introduction%20to%20Route%20Analysis.ipynb)
   - Shows how to analyze routing tables computed by Batfish.
- [Analyzing ACLs and Firewall Rules](Analyzing%20ACLs%20and%20Firewall%20Rules.ipynb)
   - Shows how to use analyze ACLs and firewalls rules using Batfish. 
- [Provably Safe ACL and Firewall Changes](Provably%20Safe%20ACL%20and%20Firewall%20Changes.ipynb)
   - Shows a workflow to ensure changes to ACLs and firewall rules are correct and safe.

We will continue to add notebooks demonstrating additional capabilities of Batfish. If there are specific use cases that you are interested in, let us know via [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/batfish-org/shared_invite/enQtMzA0Nzg2OTAzNzQ1LTUxOTJlY2YyNTVlNGQ3MTJkOTIwZTU2YjY3YzRjZWFiYzE4ODE5ODZiNjA4NGI5NTJhZmU2ZTllOTMwZDhjMzA) or by filing a Github issue.
