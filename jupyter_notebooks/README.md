This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that show how to use Batfish for different analysis and validation tasks. All network snapshots used in the notebooks are in the `networks` subfolder.

The current list of notebooks are:
- [Getting Started with Batfish](Getting%20started%20with%20Batfish.ipynb) [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca7kPAtfFqo)]
  - Shows how to get started and provides an overview of the capabilities of Batfish.
- [Validating Configuration Settings](Validating%20Configuration%20Settings.ipynb) [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOXRaVs1Uz4)]
   - Shows how you can validate different types of configuration settings (NTP server, TACACS server, AAA, SNMP, etc...) using Batfish. 
- [Introduction to Route Analysis](Introduction%20to%20Route%20Analysis.ipynb) [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AutkFa0xUxg)]
   - Shows how to analyze routing tables computed by Batfish.
- [Analyzing ACLs and Firewall Rules](Analyzing%20ACLs%20and%20Firewall%20Rules.ipynb) [[video](https://youtu.be/KixQYEDh33s)]
   - Shows how to use analyze ACLs and firewalls rules using Batfish. 
- [Provably Safe ACL and Firewall Changes](Provably%20Safe%20ACL%20and%20Firewall%20Changes.ipynb) [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJYLVL9UOWk)]
   - Shows a workflow to ensure changes to ACLs and firewall rules are correct and safe.
- [Introduction to Forwarding Analysis](Introduction%20to%20Forwarding%20Analysis.ipynb) [[video](https://youtu.be/yaJBH3ZZ5Dw)]
   - Shows how forwarding paths can be analyzed using traceroute and reachability queries.
- [Introduction to Forwarding Change Validation](Introduction%20to%20Forwarding%20Change%20Validation.ipynb) [[video](https://youtu.be/Yje70Q8R79w)]
   - Shows a workflow to ensure that changes to the network do not impact packet forwarding.
- [Analyzing the Impact of Failures (and letting loose a Chaos Monkey)](Analyzing%20the%20Impact%20of%20Failures%20(and%20letting%20loose%20a%20Chaos%20Monkey).ipynb) [[video](https://youtu.be/1adAT6FK-UI)]
   - Shows how to analyze the impact of failures on the network and conduct Chaos Monkey style testing.
  
We will continue adding notebooks that demonstrating additional use cases of Batfish.
