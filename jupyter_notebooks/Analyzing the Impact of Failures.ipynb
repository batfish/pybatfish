    "Planned (maintenance) and unplanned failure of nodes and interfaces in the network is a frequent occurrence. While most networks are designed to be tolerant to such failures, gaining confidence that they are in fact tolerant is difficult. Network engineers often reason about network behavior under failures manually, which is a complex and error-prone task. Consequently, the network could be one link failure away from an outage that leads to a massive loss of revenue and reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, based just on device configurations, Batfish makes it easy to *proactively* analyze the network behavior under failures and offer guarantees on its tolerance to a range of failure scenarios. \n",

Specifically, we will describe how to simulate a specific network failure scenario, how to check forwarding changes for all flows in that scenario, and finally how to identify vulnerabilities using Chaos Monkey style testing."
