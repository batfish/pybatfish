    "# ACL debugging with Batfish\n",
    "\n",
    "Network engineers are responsible for verifying that the ACLs in their networks are permitting and denying traffic as intended. This generally requires loading each ACL onto a lab device in order to test its behavior on a wide range of packets. Batfish makes it easy to see what each ACL will do with any packet, right down to the line of the ACL that matches it. We also provide a sanity check to ensure that every line in every ACL can match some packet that won't be matched by a previous line.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will start by verifying that `host1` in our example network is correctly configured as a DNS server, then go on to check that all ACL lines are reachable across the network. The example network is shown below.\n",

    "## Debugging how ACLs treat a given packet\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we're operating from the perspective of `AS1` and would like to confirm that our ACLs are correctly configured to enable a DNS service hosted on `host1`. Packets from `AS1` destined for `host1` will hit two ACLs:\n",
    "- Entering `AS2`, they will hit an ACL on the border router called `OUTSIDE_TO_INSIDE`\n",
    "- Entering `host1`, they will hit an input ACL `filter::INPUT`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Trace Filters question (`bfq.tracefilters`) is helpful for checking what ACLs do with particular packets. We can use it to test that ACLs `OUTSIDE_TO_INSIDE` and `filter::INPUT` permit DNS packets destined for `host1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters of Trace Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "The Trace Filters question takes in the properties of a flow and a set of ACLs to trace. The answer shows what each ACL will do to that flow and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify the flow, you must provide the source IP address `srcIp` and the destination `dst` (hostname or IP address). Optionally, you can also specify IP protocols, ports, TCP flags, ICMP codes, and other properties ([see documentation for details](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/questions.html#pybatfish.question.bfq.tracefilters)). The question will fill in any unspecified flow properties with default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of ACLs to examine can be narrowed down using these optional parameters:\n",
    "- `nodeRegex` specifies the ACLs present on the set of nodes matching the given regex\n",
    "- `filterRegex` specifies ACLs with names matching the given regex\n",
    "\n",
    "If `nodeRegex` and `filterRegex` are left blank, Trace Filters will give results for every ACL in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tip: Pull up a table of hostnames to IP addresses to help fill in `srcIp` and `dst`\n",
    "The Node Properties question achieves this nicely:"
