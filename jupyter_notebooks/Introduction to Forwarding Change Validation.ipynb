We will do this using Batfish's *reachability* and *differentialReachability* questions that can provide guarantees that our changes are correct and have no unintended side-effects. As we will see, these anaylses are a powerful way to understand, test, and validate changes to the network. \n",

    "The network is overprovisioned with failover redundancy for the core routers. All traffic is normally routed through `core1` but will automatically switch to  `core2` in case of a failure or during maintenance. In this scenario, we want to service `core1` and thus want to shift traffic to `core2`. We'll implement a change to cost out `core1`, and verify that it does not affect end-to-end reachability. In general, we care about three classes of end-to-end traffic: external-to-host, host-to-external, and host-to-host. For simplicity, we focus on the external-to-host traffic in this notebook but similar queries can cover other classes."
