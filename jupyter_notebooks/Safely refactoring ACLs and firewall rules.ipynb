    "Changing ACLs or firewall rules (or *filters*) is one of the riskiest updates to a network. Even a small error can block connectivity for a large set of critical services or open up sensitive resources to the world at large. Earlier notebooks showed how to [analyze filters for what they do and do not allow](Analyzing%20ACLs%20and%20Firewall%20Rules.ipynb) and how to [make specific changes in a provably safe manner](Provably%20Safe%20ACL%20and%20Firewall%20Changes.ipynb).\n",

    "* Line 10: Deny ICMP redirects\n",
    "* Lines 20, 23: Permit BFD traffic on certain blocks\n",
    "* Lines 40-80: Permit BGP traffic\n",
    "* Lines 90-100: Permit DNS traffic a /24 subnet while denying it from a /32 within that\n",
    "* Lines 110-500: Permit or deny IP traffic from certain subnets\n",
    "* Line 510: Permit ICMP echo reply\n",

    "The `compareFilters` question compares two filters and returns pairs of lines, one from each filter, that match the same flow(s) but treat them differently. If it reports no output, the filters are guaranteed to be identical. The analysis is exhaustive and considers *all possible* flows.\n",

    "As we can see from the output above, our compressed ACL is not the same as the original one. In particular, line 210 of the compressed ACL will deny some flows that were being permitted by line 510 of the original; and line 510 of the compressed ACL will permit some flows that were being denied by line 220 of the original ACL. Because the permit statements correspond to ICMP traffic, we can tell that the traffic treated by the two filters is ICMP. To narrow learn specific source and destination IPs that are impacted, one may run the `searchFilters` question, as shown [here](Provably%20Safe%20ACL%20and%20Firewall%20Changes.ipynb#Step-3:-Ensure-that-no-collateral-damage-has-occurred). \n",

The other similar mergers of 218.66.57.0/24 and 218.66.56.0/24 into 218.66.56.0/23 and of 218.8.104.0/25 and 218.8.104.128/25 into 218.8.104.0/24 were correct.\n",

Smaller ACLs are easier to maintain and evolve. However, the split operation is risky. We may forget to include in the smaller ACLs some protections that exist in the original ACL. We show how such splits can be safely done using Batfish.\n",

So, we should have different ACLs for different types of traffic and different ACLs for different logical groups of nodes in the network. The result of such splitting is shown below. For ease of exposition, we have retained the line numbers from the original ACL and mimic a scenario in which all ACLs live on the same device."

    "In the code above, we first enumerate all untrusted subnets in the network. The granularity of this specification need not be the same as that in the ACL. For instance, we enumerate 218.66.56.0/24 and 218.66.57.0/24 as untrusted subnets but the ACL has a less specific prefix 218.66.56.0/23. Batfish understands such relationships and provides an accurate analysis that is not possible with simple string matching.\n",

    "The **for** loop above uses the `findMatchingFilterLines` question to find out which lines across all ACLs whose names contain \"deny-untrusted\" will match packets starting the the specified subnet. Our expectation is that each subnet should match exactly one line in exactly one ACL, and the output shows \"OK\" against such subnets. It shows \"Absent\" for subnets that do not match any line and shows the multiple matching lines for subnets where that happens.\n",

More dangerously, we completely forgot to match the 11.125.64.0/19, which will open a security hole in the network if these smaller ACLs were applied."
