    "Network and security engineers are responsible for ensuring that the ACLs and firewall rules in their networks are permitting and denying traffic as intended. This task usually requires manual checking or loading rulesets onto a lab device in order to test its behavior on example packets of interest. These methods are not only time consuming but also error-prone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Batfish makes it easy to deeply analyze ACLs and firewall rules, which we generally call *filters.* It can show what a filter will do with a given packet, right down to the line of the filter that matches the packet; it can provide guarantees on how a filter treats a large space of packets; and it can sanity check a filter to ensure that every line in it matches at least some packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate these capabilities. In our [\"Provably Safe ACL and Firewall Changes\" notebook](Provably%20Safe%20ACL%20and%20Firewall%20Changes.ipynb), we show how Batfish can guarantee that filter changes are safe.\n",
