System Requirements for running Batfish
=======================================

Batfish can be run on any operating system that supports Docker.
The containers are actively tested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

To get started with the example Jupyter notebooks, all you need is a reasonably capable laptop:

* Dual core CPU
* 8 GB RAM
* 256 GB hard-drive

When you transition to running Batfish on your own network, we recommend a server that at least has:

* Quad-core CPU with 2 threads per CPU
* 32 GB RAM
* 256 GB hard-drive
