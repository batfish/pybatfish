"""Integration tests of pybatfish using Batfish service.

This test file operates over the example test rigs in the batfish repository.
It assumes that it runs from the top-level directory in the repository.

To get relevant shell commands, do:
`source tools/batfish_function.sh`

The client runs against the batfish service, hosted locally or on a remote server.
To start the service locally, do the following in a new shell:
`source tools/batfish_functions.sh`
`allinone -runmode interactive`
